<p align="left">Hi ðŸ‘‹! My name is Sujit, and I'm currently in my third year pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues Institute of Technology (FCRIT), located in Navi Mumbai, India.

As a passionate and curious student in the field of computer engineering, I enjoy exploring various domains of technology including software development, artificial intelligence, and data science. I'm particularly interested in building practical, real-world solutions and have been actively involved in academic projects that involve coding, data analysis, and system design.

Being in my third year, I'm now focusing on enhancing my technical skills, contributing to collaborative projects, and preparing for professional opportunities such as internships and placements. I'm always eager to learn new technologies, work on innovative ideas, and connect with like-minded individuals in the tech community.</p>
